## 0x1B-Web_stack_debbuging_4

This is the 5th web stack debbuging project among the webstack debugging series

In this project i am provided a broken webstack in an isolated container, and tasked to fix them.

I used Puppet to automate the fixing of the webstack to a working state.

## Tasks:page_with_curl:

* **0. Sky is the limit, let's bring that limit higher**
  * [0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp](./0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp): Puppet manifest
  that increases the amount of traffic an Apache web server can handle effectively.

* **1. User limit**
  * [1-user_limit.pp](./1-user_limit.pp): Puppet manifest that modifies the operating system
  configuration so that it is possible to login with the username `holberton` and open a file
  without encountering any error.
